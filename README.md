# Raspberry-Pi-Gate-Opener
This program is intended to open and close an electric gate on a set schedule<br />
I have reached out to the original author but have not recieved a response yet<br />
I intend to leave the shedule and add an option to open the gate for a set time off the schedule with unique passcodes<br />
