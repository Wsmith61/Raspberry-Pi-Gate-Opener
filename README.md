# Raspberry-Pi-Gate-Opener
This program is intended to open and close an electric gate on a set schedule<br />
I have reached out to the original author but have not recieved a response yet<br />
I intend to refine the schedule and add an option to open the gate for a set time off the schedule with unique passcodes<br />
- [ ] Change the schedule to include days of the week.<br />
- [ ] Add passcode functionality to the system.<br />
- [ ] Add camera system to take photos or video of anyone attmepting to enter a passcode.
